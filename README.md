# GeoPlay - A Go-based Geometric Algebra Library

This library is mainly for my own personal learning/experimentation with Geometric Algebra.  I learn best by coding.  Maybe someday it will morph into something awesome, but for now it is just for my own personal use.

NOTES - need to break complement into right/left, and then also establish whether it should be positive/negative.  Need to test Clifford Algebras which square to -1.
